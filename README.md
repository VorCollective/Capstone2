#### ðŸ”’ Data Sources & Quality
Primary Sources
-  Uber API: Real-time price estimates

-  Bolt API: Live pricing data

-  RapidAPI: API gateway services

Data Quality Measures
-  Automatic NaN/inf value handling

-  Outlier detection and removal

-  Confidence interval calculations

-  Sample size validation

Fallback System
-  When APIs are unavailable:

-  Realistic Nairobi-based pricing models

-  Traffic pattern simulations

-  Surge pricing algorithms

Distance-based calculations

#### ðŸ“Š Statistical Methods
Analysis Techniques
